        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          ProductDB grants the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
          non-assignable, worldwide limited right to use the Tool, including any
          (future) updates of the Tool, solely for its internal business
          operations.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Customer represents and warrants in any case that (i) all submitted
          (registration) information is complete, truthful and accurate and (ii)
          it will maintain the accuracy of such information.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Any other use or exploitation not explicitly granted to the Customer
          shall not be allowed without written consent from ProductDB.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          For as long as this Agreement remains in effect, the Customer can make
          use of the Tool within the scope of the rights granted at the time of
          the conclusion of the Agreement. The scope of the rights granted can be
          limited or extended during the lifetime of the Agreement.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Customer can, within the limits of the software license granted by
          ProductDB, grant an agreed number of Users a right of access and use.
          These Users can access and use the Tool, within the Customer’s internal
          business environment, under the Customer’s responsibility.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          By analogy, the obligations under these Terms of Service apply to Users
          who gain access to the Tool, via the Customer. The Customer commits to
          clearly inform all its related Users about their obligations and the
          terms of use of the Tool.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Customer shall not authorize access to or permit use of the Tool by
          persons other than the agreed Users. The Customer is responsible for the
          actions, conduct, operation and all other actions relating to the Tool,
          by its employees, officers, directors and any third parties it
          intentionally or unintentionally, gives direct or indirect access to the
          Tool.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          In case of lack of compliance with the Agreement, ProductDB can take
          measures against the Customer as well as against its related Users.

          5.2 User Account registration
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Customer shall be able to access and use the Tool through the first
          (Admin) User Account and, where appropriate, the additional User
          Accounts. The Customer shall be solely responsible for every use and
          activity of the User Accounts.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Admin determines the extent of the rights of the User Accounts and
          the Admin shall always remain responsible for granting these rights.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Each User Account (including the Admin User Account) belongs to one
          person only and may therefore not be shared with other persons. The
          Admin as well as every User is advised to create a unique password, to
          change it frequently and/or to use two-factor authentication.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Customer shall be solely responsible for the protection and security
          of the User Accounts. In this context, all Users must ensure the
          confidentiality of their respective User Account, including the
          confidentiality of the login-data such as the password. Consequently,
          they may not even disclose their login-data to ProductDB (for example,
          when seeking assistance from ProductDB through the helpdesk, see
          Article 13).
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Any damage resulting from the careless handling of these login details
          by the Customer or any of its Users is the sole responsibility of the
          Customer and can in no way incur the liability of ProductDB.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Customer must immediately report to ProductDB any (suspected)
          breach of the confidentiality of one or more User Accounts as well as
          any controversial registration so that appropriate measures can be
          taken.

          Customer commits to use the Tool for its internal business purposes

          issued by governing authorities.
        </p>

          Customer commits not to use the Tool to perform any activity which is or
          may be, directly or indirectly, unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive,

          ProductDB can take all necessary and reasonable measures when the
          Customer or any related User acts in violation of the Agreement, the
          applicable law, the rights of third parties or the generally accepted
          rules of conduct of the Internet. ProductDB preserves a large margin of
          appreciation to sanction a violation, in proportion to the violation.
          ProductDB can temporarily suspend or permanently deny access to the
          Tool. ProductDB may charge Customer for any costs incurred by it as a
          result of Customer's failure to comply with the terms of use
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          When acquired by the situation, the above mentioned measures can be
          taken without prior warning. The Customer does not have the right to ask
          reimbursements or damages for measures taken.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          If the Customer considers that the measures taken are disproportionate
          or unfounded, the Customer must bring this to the notice of ProductDB
          within fifteen (15) calendar days after the measure has been taken.
          ProductDB will take these arguments into account without being under
          any obligation to undo the measures taken.

          outdated web browser is used, the Customer may not be able to use all
          functionalities of the Tool or these functionalities may not operate
          optimally.
