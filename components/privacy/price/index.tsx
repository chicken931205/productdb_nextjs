          Any promotions, commercial offers, discounts and announcements of
          ProductDB communicated via the Website, via e-mail or in any other form
          (including, but not limited to catalogs, brochures, newsletters, folders
          and other publicity announcements), are entirely non-binding, and may
          only be regarded by the (potential) Customer as an invitation to order
          the Services, unless explicitly specified otherwise.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Any commercial discounts on the standard prices which are granted orally
          (e.g. by telephone) must be confirmed in writing (e.g. on the
          corresponding invoice) to be valid.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The (potential) Customer acknowledges that discounts shall only be
          applicable in accordance with the guidelines and conditions expressly
          stated in this regard. Such discounts are deemed to be granted on a
          one-off basis for the initial Term or the specified duration and shall
          thus not automatically apply to subsequent (similar) orders. Any other
          practice to the contrary shall be regarded as a commercial gesture and
          shall only apply as long as it is not revoked by ProductDB. The
          (potential) Customer acknowledges that discounts (as well as any other
          promotional gifts) cannot be accumulated, are personal by nature and can
          never give rise to acquired rights.

          Subscription

        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Subscription Fee is based on the following parameters:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-decimal	">
          <li className="mt-4  text-justify text-regular  text-black dark:text-white">

          </li>
          <li className="mt-4 text-justify text-regular  text-black dark:text-white">
            The Term (quarterly or yearly);
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4 text-justify text-regular  text-black dark:text-white">
            The number of User Licenses;
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4 text-justify text-regular  text-black dark:text-white">
            The Boosters activated;
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4 text-justify text-regular  text-black dark:text-white">
            The Customer Account limits.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          For the avoidance of doubt: a distinction is made between a User License
          and a User Account. The Subscription Fee is based on the number of User
          Licenses purchased, not on the number of User Accounts that are actually
          in use. When a User has been invited to activate their User Account,
          this takes up one User License. However, a Customer can decide not to
          assign a User License to a User (yet); or deactivate a User Account,
          thereby effectively freeing up a User License allowing the Customer to
          assign it to another User at a later time. This means a Customer Account
          can have more User Licenses than active User Accounts.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Additional information regarding the pricing of the Subscription can be
          found on the Website and in the Tool.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The agreed Subscription Fee for the Subscription ordered by the Customer
          during the initial Term is identified in the Customer’s license overview
          available in the Tool. In the event the Subscription Fee changes (see
          Article 4.3, price changes) and/or the scope of the Subscription changes
          at a later time (see Article 4.4, Upgrades & Downgrades), the Customer’s
          license overview in the Tool will change accordingly. Together with the
          most recent undisputed invoice, the license overview in the Tool will
          serve as proof of the Subscription Fee agreed and applicable between the
          Parties at that time.

          Without prejudice to the provisions on indexation below, an increase of
          a Customer’s Subscription Fee which takes effect during the current Term
          is considered to be a substantial change to the Agreement. Consequently,

          Such notice of termination should be done in writing to ProductDB
          before the entry into force of the new Subscription Fees. The continued
          use of the Tool by the Customer after the effective date shall
          constitute the acceptance of the revised prices.

          rates and/or other costs, ProductDB shall, in the event of an increase
          of one or more of these price factors, be entitled to index its prices
          accordingly in accordance with the legally permitted standards (for
          Subscription Fees: even during the current Term). An indexation cannot
          be considered a substantial change to the Agreement.

          The Customer does not need to take any action if it wishes to continue

          otherwise stated, the Customer's Subscription will be automatically
          upgraded with the paid Booster when the trial period expires unless the
