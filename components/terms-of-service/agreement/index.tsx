            2.2 Conclusion of the Agreement
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            When ordering the Services, either via the Website or in any other
            manner – including registration for the Demo – the (potential)
            Customer will always be asked to accept ProductDB’s Terms of Service
            and DPA. The Customer enters into an Agreement with ProductDB upon
            acceptance of the Terms of Service and DPA. Both the Terms of Service
            and DPA will be made available in the Admin User Account(s).
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            The Customer expressly acknowledges that the acceptance of the Terms
            of Service by electronic means gives rise to a valid Agreement. This
            is fully consistent with the Belgian Code of Economic Law. Within the
            limits of what is permitted by law, ProductDB can make use of all
            electronic files available to prove the existence of the Agreement.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            Anyone who enters into this Agreement on behalf of a legal entity
            represents and warrants that they have the legal authority to bind
            such entity to these Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            Please note that for customers who use the Tool through one of
            ProductDB’s channel partners the
            <Link href="#" className="px-1 text-primary underline">
              end-user license agreement (EULA)

            applies. They fall outside the scope of these Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            At all times, ProductDB shall be entitled to request additional
            information about the signatory and about the (potential) Customer.
            ProductDB shall be entitled to cancel the Agreement or suspend the
            performance of the Services in case of (i) doubts regarding the
            identity of the signatory, (ii) doubts regarding the creditworthiness
            of the (potential) Customer and (iii) indications that the (potential)
            Customer intends to resell the Services without the explicit
            permission of ProductDB. Such a cancellation of the Agreement or
            suspension of the execution of the Agreement will never entitle the
            other party to receive any form of compensation or damages.

          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            In addition to the Subscription, the Customer can also order

          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            An Agreement shall only become effective following an electronic
            confirmation of the order or upon the moment ProductDB makes the
            Services available to the Customer.

            In the event the Customer no longer has an active Admin User Account

            Following the conclusion of the Agreement, the Customer shall be
            granted access to the Tool. Providing the Customer with an Admin User
            Account is considered to be a delivery of the Subscription.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            Upon delivery of the Subscription, the Customer is obliged to carry
            out an initial verification to determine whether the delivered
            Subscription conforms to its order. This includes, among other things,
            the functionalities included in the selected Package and the number of
            User Licenses.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            The Customer is obliged to inform ProductDB within 48 hours following
            delivery of any non-conformity through the helpdesk . If no complaints
            are made within 48 hours, the Customer is deemed to have approved and
            accepted the delivery.

            2.4 No Right of Withdrawal
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            Pursuant to the Belgian Business Code (Dutch: Wetboek Economisch Recht
            or WER), every consumer (i.e. any natural person who is acting for
            purposes which are outside his trade, business, craft or profession)
            has a right of withdrawal with regard to products and/or services
            purchased through the Internet, by email or phone.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            As the Services are solely meant to be used for internal business
            purposes, any Customer is considered to be an “undertaking” within the
            meaning of the Belgian Code of Economic Law in its commercial
            relationship with ProductDB. Consequently, our Customers shall under
            no circumstances have a right of withdrawal, neither with respect to
            the Subscription nor the Onboarding Services.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
            Do note that ProductDB offers every potential Customer the
            possibility to use a free Demo account for a limited period of time
            (see Article 3.1). In addition, each Customer also has the opportunity
            to try out one or more Boosters free of charge for a limited period of
            time (see Article 3.2). By offering these free trial periods,
            ProductDB thus offers more than it is required to by law.

            The commercial relationship between the Parties shall solely be
            governed by these Terms of Service. This Agreement replaces and
            supersedes any previous agreements that may have existed between the

            prices and its Services at any time in the future. ProductDB
            undertakes to notify the Customer of these changes via a
            Communication.

            <li className="mt-4 text-justify text-regular  text-black dark:text-white">
