          The Customer expressly agrees to electronic invoicing by ProductDB,
          unless agreed otherwise in writing by Parties. All invoices under this
          Agreement will be sent to the electronic address provided by the
          Customer when ordering the Services. It’s the Customer's responsibility
          to keep its invoicing information up to date. The Customer is not
          discharged from its payment obligation and the consequences of late or
          non-payment in case ProductDB prepares and sends an invoice using the
          Customer’s outdated invoicing information.

            In case of a yearly Term: a yearly invoice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The invoice will always be delivered to the Customer prior to the start

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-black dark:text-white">Upgrades</h4>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Upgrades (see Article 4.4) which the Customer orders during the Term
          will be invoiced to the Customer immediately after the order is placed
          by the Customer. In the case of pre-ordered Boosters, the invoice is
          sent once the Booster is released and made available to the Customer.

        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The Customer purchases the Credits directly in the Tool through the

          6.2 Payment
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Unless expressly agreed otherwise, all ProductDB invoices are
          automatically collected by ProductDB in full via credit card or SEPA
          Direct Debit (SDD) – depending on the Customer’s preference when
          ordering the Services – on the invoice date. In the event of payment
          through SEPA Direct Debit (SDD), ProductDB thus formally deviates from
          the legal pre-notification duty of 14 calendar days prior to collection,
          based on internal procedures.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          For the processing of its payments, ProductDB makes use of the services
          of external professional and specialized partners who operate a payment
          platform. The online payments are built with the aid of secure
          protocols. All online payments are subject to the general terms and
          conditions of the external Admin of the payment platform, who has
          exclusive responsibility for the correct processing of all online
          payments.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The financial data of the Customer that is entered as part of an online
          payment is only exchanged between the external partner and the financial
          institutions concerned. ProductDB has no access to the confidential
          financial data of the Customer.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Invoices may only be legitimately disputed by the Customer via email (
          <Link href={"#"} className="text-primary underline">
            invoicing@ProductDB.eu{" "}
          </Link>
          ) within seven (7) calendar days after the invoice date, stating the
          invoice date, the invoice number and detailed reasons. Such a dispute
          does not discharge the Customer from its obligation to pay.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          The unconditional payment by the Customer of the invoice amount is
          considered explicit acceptance of the invoice.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Partial payments by the Customer are always accepted subject to change
          and without any prejudice, and first allocated to the collection costs,
          next to the damages, the interest due and, finally, to the principal
          sum, with preference given to allocation to the oldest outstanding
          principal sum.

          6.3 Consequences of non- or late payment
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          For each invoice that has not been paid in full or in part by the
          Customer on the due date, the latter is liable to pay – by operation of
          law and without prior notice of default – late payment interest of 1%
          per month in arrears, whereby a month that has already started is to be
          considered as fully completed, while the amount due will be increased
          with all collection costs paid by ProductDB in connection with the
          collection of the debt, plus 20% of the invoice amount, with a minimum
          of € 150 (excl. VAT) by way of lump sum damages, without prejudice to
          ProductDB’s right to claim higher compensation.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          If the Customer fails to pay one or more invoices, ProductDB has the
          right to temporarily suspend the access to the Services until it has
          received actual and full payment from the Customer. However, the
          temporary suspension of access to the Services does not affect the
          continuation of the Term. Moreover, ProductDB may unilaterally
          terminate the Agreement if the Client fails to pay or is repeatedly late
          in paying.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-lg  ">
          Late payment or non-payment will result in all other invoices of
          ProductDB to the Customer immediately becoming due and payable, even if
          they have not yet fallen due, and all permitted payment conditions will
          cease to apply. The same applies in the event of an imminent bankruptcy,
          judicial or amicable dissolution, suspension of payment, as well as any
          other fact showing that the Customer is insolvent.
